going through the lazyfoo SDL tutorials.
https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL

This is not the proper way of starting the tutorial since I've made 
the build system using CMake on command line w/ the MSVC compiler.

Code will match tutorials loosely since I am reading it and implementing
it from what I've understood and will change as I progress through the
lessons.
